<h2>EDU-SIG: Python in Education</h2>
<p>More and more, Python is <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/SchoolsUsingPython">making inroads</a> at all levels in education.
Python offers an interactive environment in
which to explore procedural, functional and object oriented approaches to
problem solving.  Its high level data structures and clear syntax make it
an ideal first language, while the large number of existing libraries
make it suitable to tackle almost any programming tasks.</p>
<p>Edu-sig, through its <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig">mailing list</a>, provides an
informal venue for comparing notes and discussing future
possibilities for Python in education.  Its origins trace to Guido van
Rossum's pioneering <a class="reference external" href="/doc/essays/cp4e/">Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E)</a>, a grant
proposal accepted by DARPA, and which provided a modicum of funding in 1999.</p>
<p>Membership includes, but is not limited to, educators using Python in their
courses, independent developers, and authors of educational materials.
Discussion focuses on Python use at all levels, from beginning to advanced
applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-2-or-python-3">
<h2>Python 2 or Python 3 ?</h2>
<p>Recently, a new version of Python (3) was introduced.  This new version
has some small but significant changes from the previous one.  The most
visible change for beginners is that <strong>print</strong> which used to be a Python
keyword</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Hello World!&quot;   # for Python 2
</pre>
<p>is now a function:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)   # for Python 3
</pre>
<p>As a result of the changes, programs written for Python 2 are likely to
be incompatible with Python 3 (and vice-versa).  Some of you may have
not control over which Python version is made available to the students.
If that is the case, you should not despair too much if you and your students
do not have access to the best/latest version of Python: Python is a fantastic
choice as a first language and
the relatively minor changes between versions do not change this fact.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> you have some control over which version of Python is made available
to the students, then you have a choice to make.  In this case, and
as a <strong>very subjective opinion</strong>, we would like to offer the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use Python 3, and more specifically version 3.1,
if you only plan to teach Python as an introductory language
(say in a CS-1 course), making use <strong>only</strong> of modules included in the standard
distribution. Alternatively, if you teach Python in languages other than
English, where non-ascii characters could be put to good use in writing
identifiers, then Python 3 should definitely be your choice.</li>
<li>Use Python 2, and more specifically version 2.6,
if you think you might be using third-party modules not included in the
standard Python distribution, or if you are not familiar with Python (in
which case you may not yet realise that you might need some third-party
modules.)</li>
<li>Consider the possibility of teaching both Python 2 and 3.
If you are teaching beginners, the only significant differences are the
print statement/function, the integer division and possibly the
input()/raw_input() changes... which you can point out as you go along.
Of course, you will have to decide on a common version to install for everyone
to use.</li>

<span id="mailing-lists"></span><h2>Mailing lists, etc.</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Edu-Sig community has its own <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig">mailing list</a>.
Two other mailing lists are of potential interest to educators: the
<a class="reference external" href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor">python tutor</a> and the general <a class="reference external" href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list">python-list</a>.  All three are available
in a <a class="reference external" href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Mail/">searchable archive</a> on
the <a class="reference external" href="http://aspn.activestate.com">ActiveState site</a>
which is also hosting the
famous <a class="reference external" href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/">Python Cookbook</a>.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor">python tutor</a> mailing list is useful to beginners learning the language
and looking for answers to their programming problems; educators are welcome
to join as volunteers; the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig">edu-sig mailing list</a> is more for discussions
about uses of Python in educational settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="free-books-and-tutorials-for-educators">
<span id="free-books"></span><h2>Free books and tutorials for educators</h2>
<p>There are a number of freely available tutorials for Python.  For example,
there is a collection of <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers">Beginner's Guide to Python</a> available on the
Python wiki.  In addition, the following may be of particular interest

<span id="textbooks"></span><h2>Textbooks and other non-free books</h2>
<p>While there are a number of <strong>free</strong> books and tutorials available, some
people prefer to have an actual copy on paper.
If you are among this group, you might be surprised to learn that there are
close to one hundred books that have been written about Python programming.
Here, we will focus only on a subset that are of potential interest for educators
who teach introductory courses in programming.  More books can
be found <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks">here</a>

<span id="learning-environments"></span><h2>Learning environments</h2>
<p>Since Python is an interpreted language, all one needs to start programming
is a terminal window.  However, for your students, this would not be
the friendliest environment; instead,
we recommend that you use something like <a class="reference external" href="/idle/">IDLE</a> (which stands
for Integrated DeveLopment Environment), which is included in the installation
Python files on any platform that supports Tcl, including Windows.</p>
<p>As for yourself, if you prefer programming directly from a terminal window,
a better choice than the default interpreter might
be <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/">IPython</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to IDLE, there are a number of third party tools which you can find out
by referring to the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors">Python Editors Wiki</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments">Python Integrated Development Environments Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>There are also a few other non-traditional Python learning environments that
you may wish to consider.  First, some general purpose environments - all three
work from a browser:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/">Crunchy</a>
is a Python program that can transform an otherwise static html
tutorial into an interactive Python session within a browser.  The basic
features of an early version of Crunchy are demonstrated in
<a class="reference external" href="http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1430000&amp;fromSeriesID=143">this screencast.</a></li>
<li>A new &quot;Mathematica-like&quot; environment for Python is <a class="reference external" href="http://codenode.org/">Codenode</a>.
You may want to <a class="reference external" href="http://live.codenode.org/accounts/login/?next=/bookshelf/">try it yourself</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pykata.org/">PyKata</a>
is a new online environment
designed as a teaching aid for Python.  It includes a small, but growing
number of programming exercises that students can try on their own
and get immediate feedback.  Educators are invited to contribute
their own exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other notables, with more restricted goals, are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/%7Edblank/pyro/">Pyro</a>
is a Python programming environment for easily exploring advanced topics in
artificial intelligence and robotics.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://gvr.sourceforge.net/">GvR</a>, or Guido van Robot,
strives to emulate the original <em>Karel the Robot</em> created by Richard Pattis.
It uses an indentation-based Python-like language and
about 20 lessons designed to teach programming concepts.
An <a class="reference external" href="http://gvr-online.appspot.com/">online demo is available.</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://rur-ple.sourceforge.net/">RUR-PLE</a>
is a Python learning environment that includes an editor, a
Python shell and, more prominently, a Karel the Robot clone that is
programmable using Python syntax, using either procedural commands
[e.g. move()] or an object-oriented approach [e.g. robot.move()].
It includes approximately 40 lessons.
RUR-PLE was inspired from <a class="reference external" href="http://gvr.sourceforge.net/">Guido van Robot</a>.</li>
<li>Python's <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/turtle.html">turtle module</a>
is not a learning environment as such, but it has been completely revamped
for Python 2.6 and above and is worth checking out.  Examples are included
in the source distribution (along with a demoViewer program,
which also serves as an example on how to embed turtle graphics into a
Tkinter application.)  For those that have older version of Python
installed (2.3, 2.4 or 2.5), a suitable version of the turtle module can
be <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/lib-tk/">found here.</a>,
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/lib-tk/">examples here.</a>
A <a class="reference external" href="http://blip.tv/file/1947495">video of the Pycon 2009 talk demonstrating the turtle module</a> is available.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<span id="videos"></span><h2>Videos</h2>
<p>There is a growing body of podcasts, screencasts and video presentations
for the Python community, many of which may be of interest to educators.

<div class="section" id="id3">
<span id="specialized-packages"></span><h2>Specialized packages</h2>
<p>Given the large number of <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/modindex.html">modules</a> included in the Python distribution,
it is often said that Python comes with batteries included.  If the standard
distribution does not include what you need, you may want to consult the
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a> which is a repository that includes close to 7000
additional packages.</p>
<p>The following represent just a small sample of what is available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>

The SciPy library depends on NumPy,
which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation.
The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many
user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for
numerical integration and optimization.
Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install,
and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use,
but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's
leading scientists and engineers.
If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or
publish the results, give SciPy a try!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a>
is a python 2D plotting
library which produces publication
quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive
environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts,
the python and ipython shell (ala matlab or mathematica),
web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.
matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible.
You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts,
scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of code.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>,

<span id="game-time"></span><h2>Game time!</h2>
<p>If it weren't for games, there likely would have been many fewer people
interested in programming - and much less free software developped as
a result.  Python has two well-known frameworks for making games:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org">pygame</a>
is the original and still very much active
package for game development using Python. It allows Python to talk to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.libsdl.org/index.php">SDL</a>, a cross-platform, multimedia library.
Because it needs to be compiled for each platform and each Python version,
there can be a lag when a new Python version comes along.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pyglet.org">pyglet</a>
is the newcomer, based on OpenGL.  Because
it is a pure Python package, it can be used as is
even when a new Python version is released (except for the Python 2 to Python
3 transition).</li>
